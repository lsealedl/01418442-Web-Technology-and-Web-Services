		<h1>The Atomic Age and J.Robert Oppenheimer</h1>
		<p>
			J. Robert Oppenheimer, a key figure in the Manhattan Project during World
			War II, played an integral role in the development of the atomic bomb.
			Renowned as a brilliant physicist, he led the team that successfully
			detonated the first nuclear weapon in 1945.
		</p>
		<p>
			Following the war, Oppenheimer became a vocal advocate for nuclear
			regulation. He opposed the development of the hydrogen bomb, emphasizing
			the need for international control over nuclear power. This stance
			highlighted his commitment to ethical scientific practices in the post-war
			era.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, during the Red Scare, Oppenheimer faced severe accusations of
			communist sympathies. This led to a controversial public hearing that
			stripped him of his security clearance, tarnishing his reputation. Despite
			these challenges, Oppenheimer's contributions to physics and his influence
			on nuclear policy remained significant until his death in 1967.
